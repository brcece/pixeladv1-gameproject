# pixeladv1-gameproject
 This project was our final assignment for the game programming course. Each level gets progressively harder. Pixel Adventure 1 was used as a ready-made asset. To pass the first two levels, collect 100 points; for the final level, collect 1000 points. All animations were manually created. The .exe file is in the game demo in the files section.
